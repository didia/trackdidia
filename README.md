==================

**Description**:  This project is an humble attempt to track almost every thing in my day to day life that can be tracked and then get insights from the data collected. Data driven insights give you an idea about what works well and what should be improved.
I will try to keep it simple and stupid but in the meantime to really get meaningful insight.

**Technology stack**: This project will use Google Cloud Endpoints on the backend side and react + webpack on the Web client.

**Status**: Extremely Alpha, this will continuously changes.

** Link to Production **: Here is the [link](http://trackdidia.appspot.com) to the live instance.
