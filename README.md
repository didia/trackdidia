Hello world!


This is the primary codebase that powers [trackdidia.appspot.com](http://www.trackdidia.appspot.com)

I use trackdidia to track my schedules, plans and discover how I am using my time.

To set up your own instance, you will need google appengine, the python sdk.
The app is pretty straightforward to use. Just head over trackdidia.appspot.com and start messing around with it
